# CTF-writeups


Beginner CTFs writeups focused on teaching people who want to start their adventure with playing CTFs.
Here I mainly focus on reverse-engineering, but you will also find solutions to binary exploitation/pwn tasks.

I try to translate my solutions as accurately as possible and understandable to each person.
