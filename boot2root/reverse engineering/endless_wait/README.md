Original binary:
Patched binary: 

I found two things that need to be patched in this binary: <br/>
- SIGALRM (https://linuxhint.com/sigalarm_alarm_c_language/) <br />
- Anti-Debug linux technique ptrace (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33646089/using-ptrace-to-detect-debugger) <br />

After patching(nop slides) our binary looks like: <br />

Now we excluded one function, so we know that second one is valid for our flag, let's chek <br />

I was very interested how stack looks after all<br/>

I put the breakpoint a bit further and read what the stack looks like

![Alt text](https://i.imgur.com/ybBsOO5.png "Title")

I read the following string: 
<b>bqz0wm0qctdn2gbrdmoazosbtsc {jmpgzadbtjc1amenzngbcnceam_gn1dzsab_ccnhm0nntlx_ackebehmyvn_lzhabencrhmevn}azqazwsxedc</b> <br />

After analyzing function strcmp would give us message is our input correct or not, but generating flag was independent of that <br />

```C
    char flag[48];
    const char* runtimeArray = "bqz0wm0qctdn2gbrdmoazosbtsc{jmpgzadbtjc1amenzngbcnceam_gn1dzsab_ccnhm0nntlx_ackebehmyvn_lzhabencrhmevn}azqazwsxedc";
    for (int i = 0; i < 0x23; i++)
    {
        flag[i] = *(char*)(runtimeArray + (i * 3));
    }
    puts(flag);
```


Flag: <b>b00t2root{pat1ence_1s_n0t_key_here}</b>
